Once upon a time, in a meadow kissed by the gentle spring sun, lived the Easter Bunny. Unlike any other rabbit, the Easter Bunny had a very special job: delivering colorful eggs filled with surprises to children all around the world every Easter morning.

Each year, as winter melted away and flowers started to bloom, the Easter Bunny would hop into his cozy burrow to prepare. With nimble paws, he painted eggs in bright hues of pink, blue, yellow, and green, carefully hiding little treasures inside—candies, tiny toys, or messages of happiness.

One particular Easter Eve, a little girl named Lily stayed up late hoping to catch a glimpse of the magical visitor. To her surprise, the Easter Bunny appeared on her windowsill, his eyes twinkling like stars. He smiled and whispered, “The joy of Easter is in the sharing—of kindness, hope, and love.”

From that night on, Lily understood Easter was more than just colorful eggs; it was a celebration of new beginnings and the happiness we spread to others. And every year, she eagerly awaited the Easter Bunny’s gentle visit, ready to join in the beautiful tradition.

Happy Easter!
